## This is my first website  1.0
I built this project after I started learning JavaScript, of course at that time is was my biggest project, I was so glad I could make my website more dynamic. 
This project is quite big also because it is a multi-language website. Even if most of the text it is dummy text, you can visit the website in English, Korean and Spanish.


## Visit the website
You can visit the website clicking [Here](https://myfirstwebsite1-0.netlify.app/)

## What is it about
This website is actually call, Vegan Ramen, it is a website show three different type of vegan ramen. 
I thought I could be a website for a food business. The only thing I did not like about this projects is that at the moment all my website look the same.
